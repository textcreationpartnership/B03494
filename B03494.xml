         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And there is that, laſtly, from which ye may read the freedom of the promiſes, if ye conſider the greatneſs of theſe promiſes: if they were of a lower nature, then were it leſſe to be wondered, if merit ſhould come in to plead for it ſelf: But when a Chriſtian ſhall compare himſelf, and the greatneſſe of the promiſes together, he cannot but then ſing that bleſſed ſong, <hi>Theſe are the gifts and donations of God, and what am I, and what is my fathers houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto,</hi>

               <p>The firſt is this, There are ſome Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that will not apply the promiſes, becauſe they are under the convictions of their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O ſay ye, if I were like <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> I would believe the promiſes; but truely <hi>David</hi> ſaid that ſame, that lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, if I were like my fathers, I would believe the promiſes, but I am not like my fathers. And therefore I would ſay to you theſe two words. 1. Are ye inferiour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſhort unto <hi>David</hi> in holineſſe, or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? We do not queſtion but all of you will anſwer, we are not inferiour to <hi>David</hi> in neceſſities, but in holineſſe; Then ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we, if ye be not inferiour to <hi>David</hi> in nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:175243:30"/>then make uſe of the promiſes: for as we cleared the laſt day, neceſſity giveth a right in making uſe of the promiſes. 2, I would ſay, I am certainly perſwaded, that ſenſible neceſſity would cut ſhort many of our formal debates, in cloſing with the promiſes, neceſſities (as ye uſe to ſpeak) hath no Law, and neceſſity hath no manners. Let me ſay that to you who will not cloſe with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that if ye were under ſenſible neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if Chriſt ſhould forbid you to cloſe with ſuch a promiſe, ye would cloſe with it though he forbid you, as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, there is nothing but ſenſible neceſſity will overcome it: neceſſity never diſputes its right, for it goeth over the belly of ſuch a diſpute, it preſently maketh uſe of that that its need calleth for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is that other miſtake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians in believing the promiſes, that they want the qualifications annexed to the promiſes, and therefore they dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Promiſe, eſpecially that promiſe of doſing with Chriſt, they think they are not under ſuch a deep meaſure of humiliation, of ſorrow for ſin, nor under ſuch lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the excellency of Chriſt. And I ſhall ſay but theſe ſix things unto theſe that will not cloſe with Chriſt, becauſe they want qualifications, or at leaſt, have not theſe qualifications after ſuch a way.

                  </gap> the apprehenſion that he hath not ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirdly, If ye want the qualifications that are required in theſe that ſhould cloſe with Chriſt in the Covenant of promiſe, then come to Chriſt to get theſe qualifications. I would only aſk at you, think ye to ſpin ſorrow for ſin out of your own hearts; Think ye to ſpin humiliation for ſin out of theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed breaſts of yours, ye muſt come to Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e. Fourthly, All the qualifications that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:175243:31"/>are annexed unto that promiſe of cloſing with Chriſt, and coming to him, they point out rather the qualification of them that will come, then the qualification of theſe that ought to come: Ye read ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as that, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are wearied and heavy loaden.</hi> O ſay ye, I am not weary, and I am not under the burden of ſin, therefore I cannot come. I will tell you what is the meaning of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; Chriſt inviteth theſe who have the greateſt unwillingneſſe, to come and get willingneſſe: But withall, it ſheweth this, none will come to get reſt from Chriſt, but theſe that are firſt weary; and that this is the Lords methode of working, firſt, to make weary, and then to eaſe; but no ſuch matter in his Word, That firſt, we muſt have a wearineſſe of our own making, or elſe he will not receive us: now but when ye come, ye will be weary, and he will receive you. Fifthly, Let me ſay to you who thus diſputes, make your want of qualifications the very ground of your clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with Chriſt. I ſhall but in three places let you ſee this ſtrange arguing of Faith in cloſing with the promiſes: There is that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.11, 12. <hi>Let thy truth continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me,</hi> that is, let thy promiſes be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed and made lively unto me, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And for the further preſſing of this, and for clearing of the way of your cloſing with him, I ſhall firſt propoſe ſome Goſpel myſteries, and ſweetly agreeing contradictions, (if ſo we may ſpeak) held forth in Scripture. 1. <hi>Come and buy Chriſt, and yet buy him without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> that is, come and receive Chriſt, and ye ſhall have as unqueſtionable a right to him as if ye had bought him, that is to <hi>but without money;</hi> ye have nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to Chriſt but neceſſities, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities biddeth you go, and Chriſt bidde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel myſterie, that <hi>we are to buy without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and without price,</hi> and <hi>yet to buy with a price,</hi> according to that word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17. there is a price put in the hand of fools, to buy wiſedome, and what is the meaning of that, <hi>to buy with price, and buy without price?</hi> It is in ſhort this, though Chriſt be offered to you in the Goſpel freely, ye muſt not ſit down, but be active in cloſing with him; What is the price that Chriſt requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of you? even this, that ye would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your ſoul deſtroving idols, and that ye would forſake your former evil wayes, and take hold of the preſent opportunity for imbracing him.

               <p>THere are three moſt glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts that God hath beſtowed upon man, there is that comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive gift of heaven, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is ſo called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. and ſure ſuch a gift as that, ought in ſome ſenſe to blind our eyes, and make us look upon all things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, as nothing. The ſecond royal Gift that the Lord hath given, is the precious promiſes of the everlaſting Covenant, which are given to us thorow him: A Chriſtian that is united unto him by the bloud of Faith, he may write this above the head of every promiſe of the everlaſting Covenant, <hi>this is mine, and this is mine.</hi> His third precious gift, is the gift of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is that grace that maketh uſe of the former two: and we conceive, that our little making uſe of theſe three excellent gifts, is the great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and cauſe why theſe four moſt ſad and lamentable evils have befallen us. 1. The evill of a ſilent conſcience, that though <hi>we be profound to commit iniquity,</hi> and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:175243:39"/>do <hi>love a reward under every green tree,</hi> yet our conſciences doth not ſpeak nor reprove us; and if at any time they do ſpeak; yet there are ſome that are ſo poſſeſſed with a dumb and deaf ſpirit, they can neither hear what God doth ſpeak, nor can they hear their conſcience. 2. The evil of a ſilent rod, we know not the voice of our rod, <hi>and who is he that hath appointed it;</hi> God doth not now open <hi>our ears to diſcipline, nor ſeal up our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> 3. There is that evil of <hi>ſilent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> the mercies that we receive of God, we underſtand not the language of them: are not our mercies Barbarians unto us, ſpeaking to us in an unknown tongue? and yet we may ſay, there is not a rod nor a mercy a Chriſtian meets with, but it hath a voice, if we did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. And laſtly, there is that evil which hath befallen us, and alas, this is the capeſtone of all, <hi>a ſilent God,</hi> who doth not hearken unto the voice of our cryes, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth about the face of his Throne, <hi>covering himſelf with a cloud in his anger,</hi> ſo <hi>that our prayers cannot paſse through.</hi> Alas, may not each Chriſtian of this time cry out, <hi>Call me no more Naomi, but call me Mara, becauſe the Lord hath dealt bitterly with me.</hi> In ſhort, I think there are theſe two things that may be our lamentation upon the high places of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Firſt, That we live without ſight of God; And ſecondly, that we live without ſight of our ſelves, and all this, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:175243:39"/>in them there were theſe four things holden forth concerning the promiſes. 1. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and fountain of the promiſes, in that word, <hi>Whereby,</hi> or <hi>by whom:</hi> 2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the promiſes which we told you, were theſe four. The firſt was, that the promiſes were free, holden forth in that word, they are <hi>Given;</hi> all the promiſes of the everlaſting Covenant being the noble gifts of God. The ſecond (of which we are to ſpeak at this time) is this, that the promiſes of the Covenant they are <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> which is imported alſo in that word, <hi>they are given,</hi> the gifts of God being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without repentance; And as to this: 1.

Thirdly, The nature of the Covenant prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, in that it is called <hi>an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>a Covenant of Salt,</hi> becauſe that Covenant is above the reach of alteration or putrifaction; And fourthly, It may be likewiſe ſhown from the conſtant experience that the Saints have had of the

               <p>The ſecond thing that we ſhall ſpeak to upon this, that the promiſes are unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſhall be to propoſe theſe ſix golden pillars and excellent foundations, upon which the unchangeableneſſe of the promiſes is built. And the firſt of them is the <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God,</hi> that there is nothing that he hath promiſed, but he is able to effectuate and to bring to paſſe: Therefore, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. when God had been paſſing many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promiſes, he ſtrengtheneth their faith with this, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God Almighty:</hi> and no doubt, <hi>where the word of this King is, there is power, and who can ſay unto him, what doſt thou:</hi> O miſbeliever of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of the Covenant, be aſhamed to caſt up your eyes to heaven above, or to the earth beneath; we think the Stars, the Sun, the Moon, and all the works of God; they may ſpeak that to you, do not miſbelieve God, but truſt in him, <hi>That is wonderfull in counſell, and excellent in working.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, the wiſdom and infinit counſel of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:175243:41"/>God, he hath not only compleat ability to accompliſh the promiſe that he hath given, but he hath the depths and treaſures of knowledge, by which he hath contrived the way of the accompliſhment of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: Hence is that word, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. that the Covenant is <hi>well ordered,</hi> which ſpeaketh out the wiſdom of God and then that word is ſubjoyned, the Covenant <hi>is ſure,</hi> yea, the Covenant of Grace is ſuch a thing, that there is ſo much of the arte of heaven, ſo much of infinit wiſdom ſhining in it, that it is called <hi>the counſel of God,</hi> Heb. 6.17. <hi>That ye might know the immutability of his counſel.</hi> The third golden pillar, is, the <hi>infinit love of God,</hi> that though there be nothing in us that can put him to accompliſh the promiſes, yet he will take an argument from his own love, to make out ſuch a promiſe to us; there is ſometimes (if not alwayes) nothing in us, but that which may ſpeak forth delayes of the accompliſhment of the promiſes; but when God can bring no argument from us, he can bring an argument from his own love, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. where giving a reaſon of the accompliſhment of many promiſes, and of his love to them, <hi>I loved you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe I loved you;</hi> there being no reaſon that can be given for love, but love. The fourth is, <hi>The unchangeablneſſe of the Promiſer,</hi> that he is the ſame, yeſterday, and to day, and for ever, and without all alteration and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change: Hence ye may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. when God is repeating many preciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.89, 90. <hi>Thy word O Lord, is for ever ſetled in heaven,</hi> and the ground of it is in the following verſe; <hi>For thy faithfulneſse is unto all generations:</hi> Hence you may ſee, that oftentimes when God is making promiſes to his own, he putteth to that word, <hi>I that ſpeak in righteouſneſſe,</hi> Iſa. 45.19. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1. O! muſt not the promiſes be unchangeable that are made by the Father who is the God of Truth? Muſt not the promiſes be unchangeable that are received and merited by the Son, that is Truth it ſelf, and the <hi>faithfull Witneſſe, and Amen?</hi> Muſt not the promiſes be unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that are applyed by the holy Ghoſt, that is the <hi>Spirit of Truth?</hi> And muſt not the promiſes be unchangeable that are made known unto us by the Goſpel, that is <hi>the word of Truth?</hi> Was there ever any who could leave that upon record of God, that he was unfaithfull in the accompliſhment of his promiſes.

The laſt golden pillar, is, <hi>The juſtice of God,</hi> His juſtice, it now putteth him to accompliſh his promiſes, mercy and righteouſneſſe have now kiſſed each other: Hence is that word, 1 Joh. 1.9. <hi>He is juſt and faithful to forgive:</hi> So that now the accompliſhment of the promiſes, it is not only an act of love, but it is an act of juſtice alſo: We confeſſe indeed, love and mercy maketh the promiſes, but juſtice and truth alſo putteth God to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of them: Hence is that word, Micah 7.20. <hi>To perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham:</hi> Why is it mercy to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and it is truth to <hi>Jacob?</hi> It is in ſhort this, becauſe mercy made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but truth did accompliſh the promiſes to <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing that we ſhall ſpeak to from this, That the promiſes are unchangeable, ſhall be, to preſſe theſe ſix duties upon you from this point.</p>
               <p>O Chriſtians and Expectants of Heaven, who have Chriſt in you, the hope of Glory, rejoyce and be exceeding glad that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are unchangeable. 1. This is a duty that is preſſed from that ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>That by two immutable things we might have ſtrong conſolation:</hi> There is exceeding much joy that may come to a Chriſtian from this that the promiſes ſhall be accompliſhed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:175243:42"/>their own time. We conceive that the word <hi>unchangeable,</hi> it is engraven upon the head of many a Chriſtians mercies. Is not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> written above the head of our promiſes? Is not <hi>unchangeable</hi> written upon the head of our bleſſedneſſe? Is not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> written above the head of our enjoyment of God? That day is coming when we ſhall have <hi>unchangeable</hi> love, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> enjoyment of God, and all things <hi>unchangeable:</hi> And we conceive, that if theſe two were believed, the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the unchangeableneſſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, a Chriſtian might walk through this valey of tears with joy, and comfort himſelf in hope.</p>
               <p>The ſecond duty we would preſſe, is this, that ye would ſurceaſe and give over your diſputings and carnal reaſonings about the accompliſhment of the promiſes, ſince the promiſes of God are unchangeable, ought not we with this to ſilence miſbelief, and all that blind humane reaſon can ſay: This is preſſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>An oath for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is an end of all ſtrife.</hi> Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of his Covenant by an oath, it ought to cut ſhort the diſputings of miſbelief; And here give me leave to point out a little theſe grounds upon which it is that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians doth ſo much diſpute the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of promiſes: and to let you ſee how all theſe grounds may be anſwered from theſe ſix pillars that were given of their unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablneſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, When diſpenſations ſeemeth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:175243:43"/>to coutradict the truth of the Promiſes, the promiſe it ſpeaketh one thing, and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſeem to ſpeak another: and this is the occaſion that oftentimes Chriſtians cry out, <hi>Doth his promiſe fail for evermore.</hi> This is clear from the practice of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. when diſpenſations were upon the top of the accompliſhment, and truth of the promiſes, then miſbelief it ariſeth as a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion mighty to war, and cryeth out, I <hi>ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul:</hi> And we conceive, that diſpenſations contradicting the truth of the promiſes, was the occaſion of his ſpeaking that word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, all men are liars.</hi> And I would only ſay to you that diſpute the truth of the promiſes upon this account, that diſpenſations contradicteth them: Do but conſider this: God in his way is not like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: Would ye know the time when the promiſes are neareſt their accompliſhment, it is then when we can leaſt ſee that they are to be accompliſhed, the promiſes are never nearer their performance, then when we think that they are furtheſt off from it: And therefore let the faith of the omnipotency of God, uphold your ſpirit under ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, then let diſpenſations ſpeak what they will, ye may anſwer all with this, <hi>There is nothing too hard for him,</hi> there is nothing too hard for the Lord. I grant this may try the ſtrength of the ſtrongeſt faith, yea, we finde it hath made the beſt to ſtagger when they had no probabilities to tell them that the promiſe ſhall be accompliſhed: this was the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:175243:43"/>ground of <hi>Sarahs</hi> miſbelief, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. that when ſhe heard ſhe ſhould bear a ſon in her old age, ſhe laughed within her ſelf, and did, as it were, mock at ſuch a promiſe: and this was the ground of <hi>Moſes</hi> his miſbelief, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21, 22. he did not ſee a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that ſuch a multitude ſhould be fed with fleſh, and therefore he did call in queſtion the truth of that promiſe: this was the ground of the miſbelief of that Lord that is made mention, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. and this was the ground of <hi>Zecharies</hi> miſbelief, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.20. But I would only ſay to you that do ſo much conſult with probability in the exerciſe of your faith, theſe two things. 1. There is nothing too hard for God, this was the very argument that God took to convince <hi>Sarah</hi> in the 14. verſ. of that 18. Chapter, <hi>Is there any thing too hard for God?</hi> And, 2. Faith is never in its native and ſpiritual exerciſe, till once probabilities contradict the truth of the promiſe, then faith it is put upon the ſtage, and then faith doth act; but as long as faith and probabilities think one thing, then the day of the trial of the ſtrength of faith is not yet come.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground upon which Chriſtians diſpute the accompliſhment of the promiſes, Is their much diſputing of their intereſt in God? Sometimes a Chriſtian will believe a promiſe, and before the accompliſhment of the promiſe come, their hope will be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, their intereſt in Chriſt will be obſcured, and then they do quite their faith in adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the truth of that promiſe. Theſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:175243:44"/>two are joyned together, want of the faith of our intereſt, and want of faith of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the promiſe, as it is clear from that word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.8. <hi>Is his mercy clean gone.</hi> There is diſputing of his intereſt, and preſently this is ſubjoyned, <hi>Doth his promiſe fail for evermore.</hi> Except a Chriſtian ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth ground of a Chriſtians diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the promiſes, is, their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the way how the promiſes are to be accompliſhed, There are ſome that ſuppoſe that when ever they cloſe with a promiſe by faith, there is no more but to enter to the poſſeſſion of ſuch a promiſe; but do not miſtake it, between your believing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and the accompliſhment of it, there may be ſad and dark dayes interveening, according to that word in <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.30. where Chriſt paſſing great promiſes to his Diſciples, He, as it were doth adde, do not miſtake me that ye ſhall have theſe promiſes without trouble and affliction, <hi>Ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an hundred fold in this life with perſecutions.</hi> A Chriſtian when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth the promiſes, he muſt reſolve to have a winter before the ſpring time come, wherein the promiſe ſhall bud and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
               <p>The fifth ground of a Chriſtians diſputing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e truth of the promiſes, is, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:175243:44"/>are long in their accompliſhing. A Chriſtian when firſt he meeteth with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he will cry forth, <hi>O I believe,</hi> but when time is taken for the accompliſhment of it, then his faith beginneth to faint, and his hope beginneth to languiſh and give over; yea, ſometimes Chriſtians they fall in this fault, when they believe a promiſe, they fix a day for the accompliſhment of it, which if God do not keep, but go over; then they immediately cry forth, <hi>What is my ſtrength that I ſhould wait, and what is my confidence that I ſhould prolong my dayes.</hi> This is clear in the practice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of having a numerous ſeed being given to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.12. the long time before that promiſe was accompliſhed in part to him, was the occaſion of his miſbelief, that he vented, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.3. <hi>O Lord, what wilt thou give me, ſince I go childeleſſe:</hi> But ye muſt know, that before <hi>the viſion ſhall speak,</hi> there is an appointed time that ye muſt wait, according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>After ye have ſuffered a while,</hi> then the promiſes ſhall be accompliſhed, and ye ſhall be made perfect.</p>
               <p>The ſixth ground upon which Chriſtians call in queſtion the accompliſhment of the promiſes, is, The conſideration of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the thing that is promiſed, when they compare it with their own worth and deſerving, then they begin to diſpute, <hi>O ſhall ſuch a thing be,</hi> ſhall unworthy I, ſhall finful I, ſhall ſelf-deſtroying I, ſhall I that <hi>am leſse then the leaſt of his mercies,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:175243:45"/>the accompliſhment of ſuch a mercy? This we may ſuppoſe was one ground of <hi>Abrahams</hi> miſbelief, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18. when he cryed forth at that ſame time, when the Lord was giving him the excellent promiſe of an <hi>Iſaac, O that Iſhmael might live:</hi> He thought an <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſuch an excellent mercy, that he could not without preſumption, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the accompliſhment of that promiſe. And, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.6. this was the ground of their miſbelief which God doth ſweetly obviate, <hi>If it be wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in theſe dayes, ſhould it alſo be wonderful in mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt ground upon which Chriſtians diſpute the accompliſhment of the promiſes, is, When in the time between their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the accompliſhment of the promiſe, they fall into ſome groſſe iniquity, this maketh them exceedingly debate, whether the promiſe ſhall be accompliſhed unto them, for ſince they have tranſgreſſed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, and have broken their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and reſolutions, they cannot ſuppoſe God will abide faithful to them, and once accompliſh his promiſes unto them, and the only way how to anſwer this diſpute, is, to look to the faithfulneſſe of God, and uſe that word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Though we believe not, yet God doth abide faithful, he cannot deny himſelf.</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:175243:45"/>that theſe accompliſhments of promiſes that come not through the lively exerciſe of Faith, doth looſe much of their ſweetneſſe, much of their luſter, and much of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Sometimes a promiſe will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed unto a Chriſtian, when he hath not been much in the conſtant lively exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith in believing ſuch a promiſe; but then the diſadvantage that attendeth ſuch a one, are not eaſily expreſſed: How often may he cry out, <hi>The Lord was in this place, and I was not aware:</hi> How little of God doth he ſee in it, how ſhort is he in praiſes and rendering to the Lord according to the good he hath receeived?

               <p>At the laſt occaſion that we ſpake upon theſe words, we were ſpeaking unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the promiſes; and we told you that there were four of them holden forth. 1. <hi>The freedom of the promiſes.</hi> 2.

Firſt, They are exceeding great, in reſpect of the great price that was laid down to purchaſe them, there not being a promiſe of the everlaſting Covenant above the head of which this may not be engraven in great letters, <hi>Here is the price and purchaſe of bloud:</hi> And no doubt this ought highly to commend the promiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> that they are bought at ſo infinite a race. Muſt they not be great and precious things that ſo wiſe a Merchant did lay down ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:175243:51"/>a treaſure for the purchaſing of them. 2. They may be called exceeding great and precious, in reſpect of thoſe great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things that are promiſed in them. Is not godlineſſe a great thing, and this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the boſome of a promiſe; Is not heaven and eternal enjoyment of God a great and precious thing? and yet this lyeth within the boſome of a promiſe? Is not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God as he is, our perfect conformity with God, our victory over Idols, great and excellent things; and yet all theſe are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in the promiſes. 3. They may be called exceeding great and precious, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the great advantage that redounds to a Chriſtian through the enjoyment of them: the promiſes of the everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (if ſo we may ſpeak) are the Penſils that draws the draughts and lineaments of the Image of Chriſt upon the ſoul, it is the promiſes of the everlaſting Covenant <hi>by which we are changed from glory to glory, as it were by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> and as <hi>Peter</hi> doth here ſpeak, the promiſes are ſuch things whereby we are made <hi>partakers of the divine nature.</hi> 4. They may be called exceeding precious, in reſpect of that neat relation that they have unto Jeſus Chriſt; What are all the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace? Are they not ſtreams and rivolets that flow from Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt is the fountain out of which all theſe promiſes do ſpring; and can this fountain that is ſweet in it ſelf ſend forth any bitter waters? muſt they not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e precious things that have ſuch a noble
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:175243:51"/>deſcent? as to be ſtreams of love flowing out from the Father to the Son, and from Him unto us, as the pouring out of the oyntment upon the head of <hi>Aaron</hi> which ran down the beard unto the ſkirts of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 5. They may be called exceeding precious promiſes, in reſpect they, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt in them are the object of precious faith: What is the meat upon which faith doth feed? is it not upon the promiſes of the Covenant, and Chriſt the kernill of them: What are theſe things that faith taketh ſo much delight in, and is ſupported by? Is it not the promiſes of the Covenant: 6. They may be called exceeding precious, in that they are the things that guideth and leadeth us to precious Chriſt. There is not a promiſe within the Book of the Covenant, but, as it were, it cryeth forth with a loud voice, O come to Chriſt, The promiſes are indeed the ſtar that leadeth us unto the houſe where Chriſt doth ly, and there is no acceſſe unto Jeſus Chriſt but by a promiſe, Chriſt is to be found there, for he dwells within the bounds of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and there he will tryſt with his people, and be found of them. And, 7. They may be called exceeding precious, in reſpect that the Saints have found ſuch ſweetneſſe, and ſuch unſpeakable delight in theſe promiſes. Did not <hi>David</hi> find a great ſweetneſſe in the promiſes when he cryed forth, <hi>The word of thy mouth are better unto me, then thouſands of gold and ſilver?</hi> Did he not find much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the promiſes, when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> promiſes: though we may ſee the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of this time in a ſpiritual fever, they have loſt their ſpiritual taſte, ſo that they may ſay, if we may allude unto that word, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.25. <hi>I am this day fourſcore years old, and cannot diſcern between good and evil, can thy ſervant taſte what I eat or what I drink.</hi> They know not what it is to be overcome with the ſweetneſſe that is to be found in theſe excellent ſtreams of divine conſolation. Laſtly, The promiſes may be called exceeding precious, in that the Saints have a high and matchleſſe account of them: Hence that word here rendered <hi>Precious,</hi> may likewiſe be rendered <hi>Honourable,</hi> which ſpeaketh forth that there is nothing that hath ſo much of the eſteem of a Chriſtian as the promiſes. Would ye put wiſdom, or riches, or honour, or what ye will in the ballance with the promiſes, they would cry forth, what ſhould I profit to gain all theſe, if I loſe the promiſes. We ſhall ſay no more of this, but that the promiſes are indeed that Aple, the eating of which would make us in ſome reſpect, (and in humility be it ſpoken) <hi>as God knowing good and evil:</hi> The promiſes are theſe things that doth elevate the ſoul unto a divine conformity with God. And oh that this might be the fruit of them the promiſes are as cords let down to ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:175243:52"/>ſinking in the <hi>myrie clay, and in the horrible pit,</hi> do but lay hold upon them, and ye ſhall undoubtedly be drawn up, and he ſhall ſet <hi>your feet upon the rock, and order all your goings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to ſpeak of the third thing in the words; which is the advantage and unſpeakable gain that floweth to a Chriſtian through the promiſes, holden forth in theſe words, <hi>That by them ye might be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine nature;</hi> which words doth not hold forth that there is any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial chance of our natures unto the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God; but only it holds forth this, that the ſoul that is taken up in believing of the promiſes, they ariſe unto a likeneſſe and conformity to him in Holineſſe, Wiſedome and Righteouſneſſe. And as to theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that come to a Chriſtian through the promiſes: 1. We muſt lay this for a ground, that the fruit of all cometh to him through believing the promiſes, and in making application of them.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is, That they do exceedingly help and promove that excellent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary work of mortification: This is clear from the words of the Text; As likewiſe from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having theſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us clearſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and spirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of the Lord.</hi> And the influence that the promiſes have upon San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, may be ſhown unto you in theſe three. Firſt, They lay upon a Chriſtian a divine bond and obligation to ſtudy holineſs,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:175243:53"/>that ſince Chriſt hath ſignified and teſtifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> His reſpects unto us, in ſo ample and lar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> a way as to give us ſuch precious promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we ought to endeavour to ſtudy holineſſe which is that great reward of love that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeeketh from us for all things that he hath beſtowed, and we receive, and this is the meaning of that, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.1. Secondly, The ſtrength and furniture of a Chriſtian for fulfilling and accompliſhing of the work of Sanctification, lyeth within the promiſes: Are not the promiſes of God unto a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as <hi>Samſons</hi> locks, in which their great ſtrength doth ly; and if once they cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off from the promiſes through miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, their ſtrength doth decay, and they become as other men. Where muſt the Chriſtian go to for ſtrength? Is it not to the promiſe: Is it not the name of the Lord; yea, this is the ſtrength of a Chriſtian unto which he muſt reſort continually. And, thirdly, the promiſes of God they hold forth that unſpeakable reward that attendeth that Chriſtian that ſhall ſtudy holineſſe. There are ſeveral promiſes of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that cryeth forth to the Chriſtian, to him that overcometh will this promiſe be accompliſhed, to him that overcometh ſhall this truth be fulfilled, and this doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly provoke a Chriſtian to wreſtle with all his diſcouragements he meeteth within the way, he burieth all his anxieties within the circle of his immortal Crown, which he hopeth for, and ſeeth in the promiſe, and his hope maketh him diſpence with his wants,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:175243:53"/>his expectation maketh him overcome his fears, and his looked for joy maketh him to diſpence with his ſorrows.</p>
               <p>The ſecond advantage, is, That the faith of the promiſes do help a Chriſtian to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and heavenly performance of the duty of prayer, and withal, mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th him delight in the performance of it: This is clear from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. where <hi>David</hi> believing the promiſes, it is ſubjoyned, <hi>He found in his heart to pray that prayer unto God;</hi> and if any will look unto the words of that prayer, they will ſee them running in a heavenly and ſpiritual ſtrain, ſpeaking him one much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, and under moſt high and majeſtick apprehenſions of his Glory, as is clear alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 147. <hi>I prevented the dawning of the morning and cryed;</hi> and as if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, would you know what made me thus fervent and diligent in prayer, it was that, I hoped in his word; and hence it is, that he hath ſo many prayers in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> all were occaſioned through the faith of the promiſes: As for inſtance, when he cryed forth, <hi>Quicken me according to thy word, be merciful unto me according to thy word.</hi> And we conceive, the faith of the promiſes helpeth a Chriſtian in his prayer to theſe four Divine ingredients of that duty. 1. It maketh him pray with faith: when once he buildeth his prayer upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, then he venteth his prayer with much confidence of hope, according to that word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.3. where ye may ſee a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and praying when he is believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:175243:54"/>and expreſſing his confidence m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſtrangely in theſe words. <hi>As for our tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions thou ſhalt purge them away;</hi> It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not ſaid thou <hi>wilt purge them away,</hi> or we deſire that thou ſhould purge them away, but <hi>thou ſhalt,</hi> which ſpeaketh forth both the confidence of Faith, and the boldneſſe of Faith: A Chriſtian that believeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, he can take the promiſe in his hand and preſent it unto God, and ſay fulfill this promiſe ſince thou wilt not deny thy name, but art faithfull. 2. It maketh a Chriſtian pray with much humility, for when he doth underſtand that there is nothing that he hath but it is the fruit, and accompliſhment of a promiſe, he doth not boaſt as thoſe that have received, but walketh humbly under his enjoyments: this is clear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. where we may ſee <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaking to God with much humility, and in the ninth verſe, he is ſpeaking to God with much Faith. And 3. It maketh a Chriſtian pray with much love: Would you know the great ground that we are ſo remiſſe in the exerciſe of love in prayer, it is, becauſe we build not our prayers upon the promiſe. And, 4. It helpeth a Chriſtian to pray with much fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency; When was it that <hi>David</hi> cryed to God? Was it not when he was believing the promiſe that paſt to him of old, we would not plead with God with ſuch remiſneſſe if we did believe the promiſes that are within the Covenant.</p>
               <p>The third advantage is, That the faith of the promiſes doth ſometimes uphold a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:175243:54"/>under his ſpiritual diſertions and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Is it not certain, that ſometimes he hath been ready to draw that concluſion, I am caſt out of his ſight, and ſhall no more behold him in the land of the living? when a promiſe hath been born in upon his ſpirit, hath ſupported him and made him to change his ſong, and to invert his concluſion. This is clear from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.18. when I ſaid, <hi>my foot ſlippeth,</hi> there is the concluſion of miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and diſpair, yet thy mercy, O Lord, <hi>did hold me up,</hi> there is the gate at which faith doth bring in conſolation, not from by gone experiences only; but certainly from that which he found in ſome precious promiſes that was born in upon his ſpirit: Many excellent cords of love hath Chriſt let down unto a ſoul, when they have been going down into the depths, and the weeds have been wrapt upon their heads: It is clear likewiſe from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81. <hi>My ſoul faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thy ſalvation:</hi> as if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, I am in hazard to give over my hope and to break my confidence: And would ye know what was it that ſupported me under ſuch an eſtate, <hi>I hoped in thy word;</hi> Hath not this oftentimes been the ſong of a Chriſtian in their darkeſt night, <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts do delight my ſoul:</hi> Faith will ſee a morning approaching in the time of the greateſt trouble; and no doubt that promiſe that upholdeth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in their doubting and moſt miſbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, the lively impreſſions of that promiſe will remain a long time with him;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:175243:55"/>and when firſt it is born in upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they will ſee no ſmall love ſhining forth in carving out ſuch a promiſe to ſuit with ſuch a providence as they are (it may be) meeting with for the time.</p>
               <p>The fourth advantage in believing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is, that thereby we have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent help to patience and divine ſubmiſſion under our ſaddeſt outward afflictions: this is clear from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse I had believed to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the living;</hi> and from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 49, 50. where <hi>David</hi> telling his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the 49. <hi>I hope,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in thy word,</hi> Immediately he ſubjoyneth; <hi>This is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in mine affliction,</hi> as if he had ſaid, if I had not had the promiſes to be my comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I had ſit alone and kept ſilence, and ſhould have remained without comfort in the day of my adverſity, and verſe 92. <hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:175243:55"/>Chriſtians croſſe: If ſenſe, reaſon, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief interpret your croſſe, they will make you cry out unto God, <hi>Why art thou become unto me as an enemie,</hi> or <hi>as a liar and waters that fail?</hi> but if Faith that noble Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter do interpret your croſſes, it will make you cry out, <hi>I know the thoughts of his heart, that they are thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give me an expected end.</hi> Faith letteth a Chriſtian ſee a bleſſed outgate and iſſue of all the ſad diſpenſations that he meeteth with. Faith, that is its divinity, I ſow in tears, but I ſhall reap in joy, <hi>weeping may be at evening,</hi> ſaith Faith, <hi>but joy ſhall come in the morning.</hi> Secondly, It affordeth unto a Chriſtian ſuch ſoul-refreſhing conſolation in the midſt of their afflictions, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they forget their ſorrows, <hi>as waters that paſſe away;</hi> this <hi>David</hi> doth divinely aſſert in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>This is my comfort in mine affliction:</hi> The faith of the promiſes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that tree which if they be caſt into our waters <hi>of Marah, they will make them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately become ſweet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth advantage is, that the faith of the promiſes doth help a Chriſtian to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtance with the world, and to live as a pilgrime, as is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. where theſe two are ſweetly linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their imbracing of the promiſes by Faith, and confeſſing <hi>that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims here on earth.</hi> And we ſhall ſhow the influence that faith hath upon this, in theſe three. 1. It maketh a Chriſtian ſee the end of all perfection here, and that there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:175243:56"/>is nothing within this Glob of the World that <hi>is not vanity and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> Faith is that proſpect through which a Chriſtian hath moſt clear diſcoveries of the vanity of all things, and this doth exceedingly help him to live as a pilgrime. 2. It letteth a Chriſtian ſee the endleſſe perfections of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bringeth it within ſight of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and everlaſting hope, and this maketh him to live as a pilgrime, and to declare plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>he ſeeketh a Countrey.</hi> And, 3. It doth exceedingly help him forward in that bleſſed work of weaning of affections from all things that are here; would you know where a Believers heart is? It is in Heaven; would you know where <hi>his thoughts</hi> are? They are in Heaven; Would ye know where <hi>his converſation</hi> is? It is in Heaven; Would ye know where <hi>his hope</hi> is? It is in Heaven, his <hi>treaſure</hi> is in heaven, and therefore his heart and his converſation is there, <hi>And Chriſt in him is the hope of glory:</hi> and indeed, more faith of the promiſes would conſtrain us all to ſubſcribe that <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> that is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p>The ſixth advantage that attendeth the believing of the promiſes, is, That it is the mother of much ſpirituall joy and divine conſolation, and maketh a Chriſtian to be much in the exerciſe of praiſe: this is clear from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.14. <hi>But I will hope continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> and then immediately is ſubjoyned, <hi>And will yet praiſe him more and more;</hi> As likewiſe from <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. and from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. If a man would have his way to heaven
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:175243:56"/>made pleaſant, and while they are ſitting by the livers of <hi>Babel,</hi> would be admitted to <hi>ſing one of the ſongs of Zion,</hi> then ought they to believe the promiſes, and to <hi>chooſe them as their heritage for ever:</hi> and then he may ſing in hope, and praiſe in expectation, though he have but little in hand for the preſent: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when he looketh to his poſſeſſion, there will not be ſo much matter of rejoycing, but when he looketh upon his hopes and his expectations, he may be conſtrained to cry ſorth, <hi>Awake up O my glory, I my ſelf will awake early.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh advantage is, That the faith of the promiſes is a notable mean to attain unto ſpiritual life: This is clear from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.16. <hi>By theſe things,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah, do men live,</hi> (ſpeaking of the promiſes) <hi>and in all theſe things is the life of my spirit.</hi> As likewiſe from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>Thy word,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, hath quickned me.</hi> O what ſpirituall and divine life doth attend that Chriſtian that is much in the exerciſe of Faith upon the promiſes: And what is the great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that <hi>our hearts</hi> are oftentimes <hi>dying within us like a ſtone,</hi> and we are like unto thoſe that <hi>are free among the dead?</hi> Is it not becauſe we do not make uſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, there is that advantage, that faith of the promiſes, it maketh a Chriſtian have an eſteem of the thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: What is the reaſon that we write this above the head of the great things of the everlaſting Covenant, this is a <hi>Zoar,</hi> a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:175243:57"/>little one? Is it not becauſe we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; great things ſometimes to us have no beauty, and there is no comelineſſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in them why they ſhould be deſired: but if we had ſo much faith as <hi>a grain of muſtard ſeed,</hi> we would cry forth, How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent are theſe things that are purchaſed to the Saints, and how eternally are they made up that have a right but to one line of the everlaſting Covenant, <hi>That is well ordered in all things and ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, ninthly, The faith of the promiſes is the door at which the accompliſhment of the promiſes doth enter in: according to that word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.45. <hi>Bleſſed are they that believe, for there ſhall be a performance of theſe things that are ſpoken of the Lord unto them.</hi> If we were more in waiting for the accompliſhment of his promiſes, <hi>the viſion ſhould speak, and ſhould not tarry:</hi> And no doubt, a mercy coming to us as the fruit and performance of a promiſe, will make it an exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhful thing; When a Chriſtian getteth leave to ſing that ſong which is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will come and ſave us:</hi> And when a mercy is the fruit and accompliſhment of the promiſe, there is a beautiful luſter and dye upon that mercy, Which no arte could ſet on, but onely the finger of the love of God. The ſmalleſt mercy then becometh a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe myſterie of love, and the moſt matchleſs myſteries of love without the exerciſe of Faith, they become as things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in our eyes, and we do not value
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:175243:57"/>nor praiſe them. Faith maketh our thoughts to aſcend, &amp; miſbelief makes our thoughts to deſcend, in relation to the mercies of heaven.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Beſides all theſe advantages, We have theſe two mentioned in the Text: 1. That by them we are partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and are brought up unto that bleſſed conformity with God, which we had loſt in the fall. 2. That by them we eſcape the corruptions in the world through luſt: Lintend not particularly to open up the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe things at this time, becauſe I am only to ſpeak of the exerciſe of Faith in the promiſes. But O what excellent mercies are theſe, to get on the beauty of the Image of God, and to get off theſe ugly defilements which were the image of Satan upon our ſouls. O how ſhould this commend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes unto us, that by faith in them, we do <hi>all behold with open face as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame from glory to glory, as it were by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which, ſecondly, we ſhall ſpeak to, ſhall be the advantages that reſults to a Chriſtian from a ſpiritual obſervation of the Lords accompliſhing his promiſes; for here ye ſee in the Text, the Apoſtle maketh an obſervation of theſe excellent things that are the fruit of theſe precious promiſes when they are accompliſhed. And the firſt advantage is, That it ſtampeth the ſoul of a Believer with moſt divine impreſſions of love: This is clear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.15. where <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cryeth out, <hi>What ſhall I ſay, he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:175243:58"/>hath spoken it, and himſelf hath done it,</hi> being as it were, aſtoniſhed and overcome with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is more love in performing one promiſe, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is one wonder of condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, that God ſhould obliege and bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us by promiſes: and another depth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond advantage is, That the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of accompliſhment of promiſes doth bring in to the ſoul new diſcoveries of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:175243:58"/>his promiſes ſhould paſſe unto performances. And hence it is alſo, that when the Lord is ſpeaking of the accompliſhment of great promiſes, he doth ſo often in the Scripture ſubjoyn that word, <hi>Ye ſhall know that I am Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 49.23, 52. and 60.16. And indeed we do daily find it ſo; for, is not every accompliſhment of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, a new diſcovery of the <hi>wiſdome of God,</hi> that ſhineth in the ſuitable tyming of the accompliſhment of a promiſe: Is not every accompliſhment of a promiſe a new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>the faithfulneſse of God,</hi> that he will not alter that which hath gone out of his mouth? And is not every performance of the promiſe a new diſcovery of <hi>the love of God,</hi> that he deſireth to magnifie his mercies above all his work, and a new diſcovery of the <hi>power and Omnipotency of God,</hi> that can bring forth the performance of his promiſe, notwithſtanding of all things that are in the way, yea, <hi>make things that are not to be, and bringeth to nought things that are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third advantage is, That is helpeth a Chriſtian to have high apprehenſions, and majeſtick uptakings of God: This is clear, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. where <hi>Paul</hi> cloſing with that promiſe, <hi>That Chriſt came in the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the accompliſhment of it, in himſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Faith letteth a Chriſtian ſee theſe excellent obligations of love that Chriſt hath impoſed upon us; Faith letteth us ſee the ancient and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love of Chriſt; Faith is that grace that letteth us ſee his ſufferings; Faith let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us ſee all that he hath done for us, and this maketh the Chriſtian to cry out, <hi>Do I thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh one and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> And no doubt, if a Chriſtian were more taken up in the ſtudy of this duty, he would be leſſe in contracting debt, and were you but ſeriouſly taken up in the ſtudy of theſe two great Regiſters. 1. The Regiſter in which all the infinit acts of love are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. And, 2.

               <p>Secondly, The moſt part of Chriſtians, they are not ſtrong and vigorous in actings of their Faith, their Faith is exceedingly weak, and ſo they cannot bring forth theſe noble fruits and effects of Faith. If we were truſting in God with all our hearts, then that promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed to us, <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and he ſhall bring it to paſse.</hi> Thirdly, There is a ſtrong heart conjunction and ſoul-union between us and our idols: we are joyned to our idols, and therefore we cannot be eaſily devorced; yea, when we are in the heat of the war againſt them, there is a procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour within that cryeth, <hi>O spare this little one,</hi> or this <hi>profitable</hi> or <hi>pleaſant</hi> one, and this is ordinarily our practice, to ſpare the choiſeſt of our luſts; ſo that our <hi>Agags</hi> may cry forth, <hi>The bitterneſſe of death is paſt.</hi> But I confeſſe, if that union were once diſſolved, we ſhould then be heard with greateſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe to cry forth, <hi>O bleſſed be the Lord that teacheth my hands to fight.</hi> Fourthly, Sometimes a Chriſtian layeth too much weight upon the actings of Faith, and doth not imploy Faith, but as an inſtrument to which Chriſt muſt beſtow ſtrength to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. Sometimes we think that faith hath the vertue of overcoming in its own hand, but remember, Faith is but an empty thing without Chriſt: as ye may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. where the <hi>purifying their hearts by faith</hi> is aſcribed to the holy Ghoſt: ſo that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of faith is from him, and not in it ſelf. Fifthly, A Chriſtian doth not hate ſin with

                  </gap> warfare with his luſts, and with theſe ſtrong idols that are within him, but there is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret heart inclination to that very idol which he doth oppoſe: So that oftentimes there is that twofold contradiction in a Chriſtian; Sometimes his light will cry, mortifie ſuch an idol, and yet his heart will cry, O ſpare ſuch an idol; yea more, ſometime his heart will cry, mortifie ſuch an idol, and yet his heart will cry, O ſpare ſuch an idol: That is to ſay, there will be one part of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction crying one thing, and another part of it will cry another thing. O! but there is a remarkable command for the perfect hatred of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Abhor that which is evil.</hi> The word is in the Original, hate evil, as ye would do hell, that is, have perfect hatred to ſin, O to hate iniquity as much as hell: and joyn that word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Reprove the unfruitful works of darkneſse;</hi> or as the word may be rendered, <hi>Make out by unanſwerable arguments</hi> to your tentations, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor imbrace the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>convince</hi> your tentations that ye cannot do it: As we ſuppoſe, it was a noble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing of <hi>Joſeph</hi> when he was tempted, <hi>How ſhall I do this?</hi> he put the tentation (as it were) to it: O tentation give me on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtle in this Chapter is vindicating his Miniſtery and Apoſtleſhip, from the contempt that was caſt upon it, he proveth he was a Miniſter of the New Teſtament, called and ſent of God, by the bleſſing and ſucceſſe he had among them, in that he had not plowed nor threſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in vain; and they being ſo much in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring his way, and ſeeking an account of his Miniſtery: In theſe words, he doth (as it were) draw them off by a holy diverſion unto another buſineſſe, as if he had ſaid to them, O <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I will divert you from the exerciſe of judging me, and will lead you into an exerciſe that is more divine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; be much in judging and examining your ſelves: and indeed, it is a truth worth our obſervation, that if we were more in judging of our ſelves, we would be leſſe in judging others: but alas, there are ſome of us, we are ſo much abroad, that we cannot be much at home.</p>
               <p>In the words, there is theſe ſix things conſiderable. Firſt, That there is ſuch a thing attainable by a Chriſtian while he is here, as a diſtinct perſwaſion and aſſurance that he is in the Faith, and hath an intereſt in Chriſt: <hi>by being in the faith;</hi> here is not to be underſtood, a being in the <hi>doctrine of Faith</hi> only, but it is to be underſtood of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, being indeed and really united to Chriſt by Faith.
